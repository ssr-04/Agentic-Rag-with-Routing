# Folder Structure Analysis Report

## Summary
The codebase represents an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system implemented in Python, organized in a phased development approach. The project consists of two main phases: Phase-1 for document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and index building; and Phase-2 for the core logic of query classification, retrieval, and answer generation. The folder structure is minimal but functional, with clear separation between the phases.

## Directory Layout
- `/Phase-1`: Contains the implementation for the first phase of the RAG system, focused on document processing and indexing.
  - `phase1_build.py`: Script for processing PDF documents, creating paragraph-level chunks, generating embeddings, and building hybrid FAISS (dense) and BM25 (sparse) indexes.
- `/README.md`: Comprehensive documentation of the project, explaining the features, prerequisites, installation, and configuration.
- `/agentic_rag_phase2.py`: Main implementation file for the second phase, containing the core logic for the agentic RAG system.

## Observed Patterns
- **Phased Development**: The codebase is organized by development phases rather than by functional components, reflecting an iterative development approach.
- **Monolithic Files**: Each phase is implemented as a single, large Python script rather than being broken down into modules or packages.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Despite the monolithic file structure, there's a clear logical separation between the data processing phase (Phase-1) and the query handling phase (Phase-2).
- **Implicit Directory Structure**: The code references additional directories that don't appear in the top-level structure:
  - `docs/`: Expected to contain PDF documents for ingestion
  - `cache/`: Used to store generated artifacts like indexes and embeddings

## Details
### Phase-1 Structure
The Phase-1 implementation (`phase1_build.py`) follows a pipeline architecture with these main components:
- PDF extraction and cleaning
- Advanced paragraph-level chunking
- Embedding generation with Gemini
- Hybrid indexing (FAISS + BM25)
- Hybrid retrieval functionality

### Phase-2 Structure
The Phase-2 implementation (`agentic_rag_phase2.py`) implements an agentic approach with these key components:
- Gemini LLM integration for query classification and answer generation
- Hybrid retrieval from Phase-1 indexes
- Redis-based caching layer for query-answer pairs
- Internet search fallback using Serper AI
- Confidence scoring for generated answers

### Confidence Level: High
The folder structure analysis is based on direct examination of the code files and their contents. The purpose and relationships between the files are clearly documented in the code and README.md.
